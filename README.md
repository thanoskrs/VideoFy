We implemented a video-sharing app called VideoFy, that allows users to
create and share short videos on any topic.

The backend consists of 3 servers, each of which is responsible for user 
communication between a range of topics/hashtags and a master server that 
is responsible for assigning server responsibilities and initially connecting 
users to the system. The backend is written in Java,using Java Threads and Sockets.

We implemented the frontend in Android Studio, using Java.
